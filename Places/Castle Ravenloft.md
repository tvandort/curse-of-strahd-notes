# Ravenloft

## Dining hall
There is nothing behind the painting in the dining hall.
Turns out there's an extra pedal on the organ that slides the organ to the side.
There appears to be a tunnel behind it. 

## Chapel
Altar with angelic figures and grape vines. Silver statute of priest kneeling in supplication. Lots of bats on the ceiling. 

## Outside
Door that looks like it might lead inside to the organ?

## Basement
Kitchen sort of thing? Smells like decay.

Room filled with a bunch of bullshit that seems like someone might live there?
