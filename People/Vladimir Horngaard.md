Resistant or immune to necrotic damage. 

Vladimir was a knight in the Silver Dragon's court.

[[Strahd]] killed him when [[Strahd]] was still a vampire. Does not want us to kill [[Strahd]] because he believes that [[Strahd]] being alive means that [[Strahd]] will continue to eternally suffer. Attacked us when provoked by Shivers.

Is able to summon something like #revanants.

We killed his current form but he promises to come back to kill us each individually.
