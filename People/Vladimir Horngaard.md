![Vladimir Horngaard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/13140/916/1000/1000/637375867089360335.jpeg#.png)

Resistant or immune to necrotic damage. 

Vladimir was a knight in the [[Argynvost]]'s court.

[[Strahd]] killed [[Vladimir Horngaard]] when [[Strahd]] was still a general. Mentioned that Strahd killed the knight he loved. Does not want us to kill [[Strahd]] because he believes that [[Strahd]] being alive means that [[Strahd]] will continue to eternally suffer. Attacked us when provoked by Shivers.

Is able to summon something like #revanants.

We killed his current form but he promises to come back to kill us each individually by taking over other corpses.
