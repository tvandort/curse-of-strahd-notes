Located in [[Argynvast]]

Fought [[Strahd]] before he was a vampire as well. Also a member of the order of the silver dragon. Loyalty to [[Vladimir Horngaard]] keeps him here.

Pieces of [[Argynvast]] were scattered in places. Bringing the pieces back together might put [[Vladimir Horngaard]] to rest.

Took magic sword and holy symbol that belonged to [[Vladimir Horngaard]] back from [[Shivers]] and [[Firaxel]].
