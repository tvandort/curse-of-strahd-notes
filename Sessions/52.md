Talk about telepathic bond spell while walking past [[Vallaki]].

Rinn connects us by Telepathic Bond.

Asks Piddlewicks if he wants to connect. He shakes his head violently "No."

Connects Little Toadie who can't so much talk as convey strong emotions and intents.

We test out the connection.

Firaxel talks to [[Lathender]]. 

> F: Does strahd mean to capture us?
> L: He plans something.
> F: Is Ireena there of her own volition?
> L: That is hard to answer at this point.
> F: Does Strahd plan to hurt Ireena?
> L: Yes.
> F: Alright I thank you my lord.
> L: Beware of those who would impersonate me.
> F: Thanks.
> L: Good luck my child.

Explain what a wedding is to Korvash cause he doesn't know. Korvash thinks it's kinda stupid.

I went out first and immediately encounter Devana.

Rahadin is also there.

Rahadin says that we must recite the words of hospitality.

There are those weird Divinity 2 claw things.

>Swear to me here and now at this hour, swear to me long swearing thing.

Rahadin says take off the armor and weapons or leave.

Arabel calls us smelly.

Lots of people who we know are here and even some that we don't.

Devana
Irwin
Ismark
Arabel


Good berrys taste like Wasabi then Chocolate

Ismark not happy, last attempt to get Ireena away from Strahd. Kinda blaming us but then realizing it isn't our fault.

Make small talk. Ismark's invitation was delivered by bat.

Devana already like 8 glasses in.

Firaxel fakes going to take a shit to ritually cast detect magic instead.

Rahadin tells Rinn he'll take her to talk to Ireena. Tells the rest of us to go talk to Strahd in the dining hall once Firaxel is done pooping.

There's a plot to do harm to Ireena made by Strahd's other wives. THey're not happy about the wedding and apparently Roy has been helping them.

Rahadin leads Rinn up the staircase to Ireena's room.

MC Escher is there and is not exactly happy.

Ireena is there looking very made up with a ruby the size of a pinecone.

Appears to be slightly smiling looking distant however. She see's Rinn and the smile is almost genuine for a moment. She gives Rinn a big hug and

> I: You've actually come.
> R: Wouldn't miss it.

Irena's smile fades as she looks through the door.

Sasha is there in a scarlet dress with a fanged smile.

> I: Listen Rinn I wanted to ask you: would you be my maid of honor?
> R: Well I'm here, I might as well be.

Ireena looks sad at that answer.

>R: Of course I will.
>I: *don't let me marry him, I'd rather die a thousand deaths than be his, he calls me _tatiana_*

Behind Rinn Sasha clears her throat.

> Are you done?
> R: She's the bride its her day

Rinn pulls out the big guns pulling rank on Sasha.

Sasha kicks Rinn out to go be with her "stupid party."

Hugs happen.

Rinn says to Ireena that she looks beautiful.

Sasha's pissed. Escher laughs.

> R: Congrats you're soon to not be the youngest.

That wipes the smile off of Escher's face.

Coming up Rinn see's Strahd grinning ear to ear.

> S: Good evening my most anticipated guest. I'd stay but there are other matters to attend, Excuse me.
> R: Good evening to the groom.

Strahd tells us we can leave by dawn tomorrow.

Let us part not as friends but as equals.

Korvash gets the gift of a pair of pants.

One of his hands seems to be fake, like artificer made.

There's maybe two STrahds. One said we can leave one was with Ireena.

We talk about this with the mind link bouncing around that Korvash can do. 

We ask Devana to check into the double Strahd scenario and to get us some weapons.

Wendak does not intend on using a dagger really.

Devana hides a dagger for Wendak.

BigToe and Korvash try to get back into the dining hall.
