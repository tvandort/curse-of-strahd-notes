Walk into a really fancy dinner party. After Jojo lies poorly to get us in then prestidigitates us to be clean after we were asked to clean up. Man with flushed face and tiny dog says its a shame that Fidatov and Dimitri didn't work out. (?????) This guy seems to be hitting on Xavier. Apparently the Fidatov Dimitri thing was yesterday? Boy that sure doesn't make sense.

I think someone wants to fuck Xavier maybe? He goes off with that man Wendak follows behind doing assassin's creed shit.

Shiver's plays piano and talks to the band. Seems like the party goers have some working relationship with Strahd.

Yeah that guy was trying to fuck Xavier. It seems like Arogar is also taken to go get fucked? Why is everyone so horny here.


Jojo overhears:

"Where's the crypt at? Why is it always such a secret. Is it in the cellar? Wouldn't make sense would it?" from conversations.

Jojo goes invisible to try to find a crypt that she's overheard about.

Shivers wanders into some rooms to see if they're open. Then he finds one with a dining table & people. He sits down scaring the shit out of them because of how fucking scary he is. Informs folks of the fact that Lady Wachter was the burgomaster. They disagree.

Seems like these folks lost their memories or maybe are on a loop? Could be some The Shining shit. They think the Burgerman in Vallaki is Vargas' father.

Arogar is from the Vallachan jungle?

Man Arogar is fucking awkward with women lol. Making weird groaning noises now. Went to stick head in water after woman removes his mask and kisses him.

Tall lady from Resident Evil walks out.

She smiles and nods at the butler. He moves aside. She then starts to 

Vargon Vallakovich is Vargas' father.

Looks like the time we left behind outside.

Fidatov starts wobbling and drops glass. Shivers slaps some points of lay on hands into her.

More people start becoming poisoned(?)

Then everything around us looks fucked up suddenly.

Its current time. Stuff is gone. We go to check on Lady Fidatov. Her corpse is shimmering. A ghost pops out after Jojo shadow gets zucced towards it.

Valetian Fidatov warded the crypt. 


Hedges look like they're covered in an oily substance. Wendak can't get in cause the maze is locked.

The rest of the group goes behind the weird fancy door.

Jojo's shadow does weird shit again.

There's a medallion in a mirror that isn't in real life but is in the mirror?

Looks like theres' two peices. The diary we found of Fidatov seems to indicate you may need two halves of this to break a ward.

Xavier steps through mirror and is in a reflected version of the room. He see's himself and Jojo.

They're fighting themselves from the mirror dimension fucking metal.
