Pushed the parts of the painting together. Beacon flickers with a brilliant silver light. A luminescent shape fills the frame and vanishes. Room goes dark. Huge spectral silver dragon appears and fills the room. Looks at us. Says:

> My skull lies with a witch in the swaps. She uses it as a vehicle. Return my skull to its rightful crypt and my spirit will shine here forever giving hope to this dark land.

Hallowed mausoleum of [[Argynvostholt]] is where to place the skull that the witch rides.
