What are Korvash's last thoughts as he plummets? Thinking about his friends in the feywild dancing around with them n shit. And the taste of a goodberry.


Rinn gets green beamed by Strahd. It's something that like straight up age deathify her. She thinks of how she stood by Ireena even if she failed her, and Fey.
