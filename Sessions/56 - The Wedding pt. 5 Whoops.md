Basement: 
Shivers and BigToe fight strahd

[[Mordenkainen]] helps Wendak with cold energy while apologizing?

BigToe gets downed by Strahd and goes after Shivers

Shivers thinks back to the last time he was in a dark damp place left by himself.
Shivers says: "Savnok I need your help old friend."

Suddenly Shivers feet are dry and hes not splashing around. 
Shivers hears "thats the best i can do for you now"

Shivers immediately trips over a throne because he was only moved like 20 feet.

Then Shivers slams his head into a door.

Sees a room with a tall white flame that throws no heat in a brazier. It has 7 cup shaped indentations. Wood framed hourglass as tall and wide as a dwarf hanging by chains above all of the sand is at the top. 

Two 9 foot tall knights on horses facing each other in alcoves.

Shivers misty steps to the other side and goes into the middle of three doors at the back of the room.

---

Devana is walking somewhere the beating heart in the castle. Its very loud it vibrates the stairs of a huge tower. spider climbs up. Not even half way to the heart after going 60' up using the climbing.

---

Wolves attack [[Mordenkainen]] and fuck him up. [[Mordenkainen]] hits back with some cold shit and wipes the wolves.

Apologizes for getting taken over by Strahd.

---

BigToe makes another save.

---

Strahd comes for [[Mordenkainen]] Wendak gets up next to [[Mordenkainen]].

---

Devana continues towards the heart thing. The heart is really fucking loud still.

---

Shivers continues down the hallway

---

Strahd tries to take over Wendak. Mord counters.

Wendak slashes Strahd but heals immediately.


---

Devana runs her blade along the side of the heart and asks the blade "hungry?"

> ?: Heheh you're finally doing something useful aren't you.

Devana attempts to stab the heart thing, twice but can't. Devana jumps on the heart and its warm(?)

---

Mordenkeinen firebolts the door down. Talks to Wendak about saving Firaxel and Rinn.

---

Shivers continues down a dark hallway and enters a much larger space? Feels the presence of something and there's thick fog instead of dark oops.

Tries to make a deal for safe passage by calling out and asking.

No its definitely dark.

Shivers hears lots of bats. Like way too many bats.

The bats are reeeing.

---

BigToe looks at Little Todie says "find wendak" and dies.

BigToe sees grey light and a mist and hears a voice. A familiar one come to him. In this seeming void of mist it says "TONY IF YOU THINK YOURE GETTING AWAY THAT EASY YOU HAVE ANOTHER THING COMING TO YOU"

Tony accepts a deal to come back?

---

Mordenkeinen and Wendak discuss strategy. They don't have anything to heal anyone. Go to break down door to try to get Firaxel.

---

Devana tries to stab the heart and nat 20s it.

Liquid beneath the crystalline structure. Blood starts pouring out as a scream is heard from some sort of creature.

jumps up to the sixth floor.

Chest with an emblem. Bed. Stairs with a pool of water underneath them (possibly leads outside?)

Devana recognizes the crest as the Strahd family crest.

---

Shivers goes further into the mist and darkness. Feels a stone slab after rounding some corners blind. Its almost like a door.

Pushes stone door aside. Immediately trips on something sharp and stumbled onto a ribcage lying on the ground. then hears rumbling and some sort of large creature sound.

Sharp teeth bite into Shivers. Claws of stone rake Shivers.


---

Devana has looked like Strahd this whole time and leaves through the trap door and starts flying away.


---

Shivers being attacked by something of stone in a tiny room.

Activates heroism charm

Strikes out blindly against what was attacking him, hits it a decent amount

---

Wendak recovers Firaxel and drags him out past the gargoyles as Morden casts a shield barrier that prevents the fire from getting to us.

---

Devana asks if that was good enough for the blade

> ?: You can never just finish a job can you.
> D: I can stick around for more jobs
> ?: this isn't a game Devana do you want ultimate power or not?
> D: Well ultimate may be taking it a little far.
> ?: Ugh go home you're drunk

Devana sticks her tongue out at the blade and lets herself fall until she can see the ground.

Flying down like that seems to have sobered Devana up a little.

She sees on the bridge a red robed figure running up to someone lying on the crossbridge and another short individual dragging a taller elf.

Devana plops down on the roof as Strahd Wendak hears her and sees her clumbsily hide.

---

Shivers is beating the shit out of whatever this is in the dark mist?

Tells it to get out of here cause he has things to do fucking lol.

The thing fights back trying to wear Shivers down.

---

Wendak sees strahd drop off the castle and drunkenly put his hand on the shield that Mordenkienen casted

---

Shivers continues to fight whatever it is in the darkness. The monster knocks shivers out. Starts rolling death saves.

Shivers dies and feels his body flowing along a river of mist being carried. It's relaxiing he hears a familiar voice:

> SV: Shivers Id on't think your journey ends here. I can bring you back it just isnt' easy for me it'll take a lot of my energies. Would you be ok with getting closer to me in order to come back?
> S: You've been one of my oldest friends I feel so close to you already a little more couldn't hurt.
> SV: you're sure shivers?
> S: I feel like there's more I still have to do.
> SV: Then i'll help you. And you'll _help me_
