Looking for treasure.

Walk into upstairs room:

Figures on stained windows doing religious rites(sp?)

There seems to be something up with this room like some sort of you see stuff then you don't.

Saw some pentagram monster?

>a slender, fanged crimson shadow
>
>a skull with an intricate pentagram imprinted upon its forehead
>
>a dark star with many tendrils extending from its form

Found a celestial book.

Shivers describes the middle image on the stained glass, the skull, as something similar in [[Sykane]]'s tower. 

Rinn tries to identify what's going on with the stained glass.

Most of the party goes to check the room behind the room where we met the [[Argynvost]] image.

Nothing out the windows of the empty round room.

[[Korvash]] runs outside and the statue's mouth opens and breathes cold air on him?

Go downstairs. Hallway towards the north of the establishment. [[Firaxel]] heads down hallway and there appears to be a corpse at the end.

Room to side, beds with canopies. Fireplace black with soot that has a soft hissing sound coming out of it.

Firaxel threw a lit up ball bearing at the fireplace. It made a fleshy instead of a sooty sound. It made a ridiculous like elephant noise thing?? It tries to fly past us.

It flies past us. No one could figure out wtf that was.

[[Korvash]] continues to look for [[Esmerelda]]

Couldn't find her and continues to look.

Firaxel finds nothing in the smoky room.

Wall of stone separates [[Wendak]] and [[Firaxel]] as we roll initiative.

7 #revenants attack [[Firaxel]]. Wendak, Rinn, and Shivers work at breaking down the wall.

Break the wall down while Korvash is looking for another way up. He jumped out the window actually.

Start attacking the #revenant.

[[Firaxel]] goes down because he didn't dodge thinking the #revenants wouldn't do much damage.

[[Korvash]] turns into a spider and climbs up the building to heal [[Firaxel]] bringing him back up.

Wendak dashes into the room. Wendak hit. Shivers down.

Shivers back up cause of Korvash again, goddam.

Firaxel down again.

Firaxel up again.

Shivers down again.

Firaxel down again.

Finally killed the #revenants and got people up.
