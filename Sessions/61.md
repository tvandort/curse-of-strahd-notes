 Shivers does some creepy starfish shit.
 
Long rest.

Bigtoe plays with mouse.

Bring Jojo up to the weird wall mural.


Saint Andral, the Morninglord, and Saint Markovia

Saint Markovia is who the abbey in kresk is named after.

Abbot of Saint Markovia, he kind of is up trying to or, is trying to uphold the legacy of Saint Markovia.

Saint Markovia is from hundreds of years ago mostly legend at this point.

Saint Andral was for morning lord. Buried in Vallaki church.

Jojo doesn't see anything on the wall.

The tower is lit up now no more shadow man. Blinding light.

Apparently the mural is minor illusioned but its off.

Jojo identified so she gets info about it. Apparently it activates a while after no one has been in the room then enters the room.


check a bunch of empty already looted rooms

mountain scape in a washroom that we recognize as the balinok mountains

BigToe tries to hear. Apparently Toady and the mouse are talking.

There's a weird illusion of shiver's head in the corner of a room behind a curtain.

hear somber tones of bell in abbey. its kinda inviting

apparently the town is insular.

Dmitri Krezkov lets us in after asking us to agree to help.

people really dont like that we're here they seem nervous.

Dmitri's boy Ilia died a few days ago. Begged the abbey's favor. He wasn't interested in looking at the kid. Kid was dead for a month and now is eating like a fucking monster.

Their food supply is dwindling, sheep that is.

Brings us to his house. Farmers tip their hats.

Luca Barbu is a little slow and is losing sheep. Hard to communicate with. If he gets frustrated he flys into a rage hitting himself. Not a great sight.

Young boy, Illia 10 years old eating food at table. meet the kid and the wife.

Jojo asks about warm clothes. Tells us fifth house on the road up to the north.
