## Dreams

### Wendak

Wendak finds himself in a dream, everything is dark around you like a dark sphere. Almost like the extreme hallucination that mordenkienen was in. Blackness.

Kind of like a zen garden in the middle o fnowhere.

I see a lot of statues carved of lots of scenes of intense violence many creatures wrything in their death throws. Over a dozen at first glance.

I haer nothing except a trickle of some water looks like theres a pond.

Approach a massive weathered something like a cow with huge horns and two legs. At the moment its not walking its on its hands and knees. Burns carved into statue like melting. One hand out mouth open in horror.

No answer to saying hello it echos back.

Lots of paths of sand seeming at random.

Bridges over ponds.

Next statue thing, looks like a female elf in heavy armor carryinga magnificent lownsword except. In the hand that's holdin ghte sword you see her left hand over right hand again screaming looks like the right hand is shriveled and decaying falling apart.

Am human covered in postules and pocks frozen staring at their ahnds

One statue is way more intricate an ddetailed than the others. It looks like a man sitting in a chair and a woman standing over him both completely naked. This woman is standing over the man in this chair her face mostly covered by long hair falling forward.

Mans wrists are cut. Both incredible beatiful and you can see a bit of the mouth area and cheeks. Expression of extasy or pain and while I'm looking at the statue this violent scene there's a whisper in your ear right next to me.

> That is my personal favorite.

Oily circle with purple visage of a voluptuous woman. 

I saw her appear in the following way: Back oily circle floated towards me and rising out of it sleek this woman rises up from the circle.

Place represents "death" in various methods

Asks why I didn't use gift. Reminder that those who wait for opportunity never get it, you have to seize it for yourself. Pulls out the knife from the statue. Drips venemous green goo that sizzles as it hits. 

Really is a gift. DNA Strand blade with a gem. Requires me to use it.

Got a [[Dagger of Venom]].


### BigToe
BigToe wakes up. Sitting in a wooden chair. Right in front of him is a long wooden slab of wood. Very thick on thick legs. He sees dark stains of brown on this thing. He's in a small room on a halfling sized chair. Everything is halfling sized. Lots of cooking / torture instruments. He smells meat. BigToe gets up and tries to follow the meat smells.

BigToe sees that the knives seem to be specialty tools for cutting meat, like butcher shop tools.

For some reason BigToe just knows where the meat is now. Sees a bunch of packed meats on shelves, pork, cow everything, salted, venison, anything.

BigToe proceeds to eat the gabagool. While he's doing it he hears from the door 

>TONY BIG TONY IS THAT YOU IN THERE

BigToe shoves meats into his pockets as fast as possible.

Too busy stuffing pockets to see who enters.

Multiple voices start talking about Tony being home "it took forever".

BigToe also sees these black oily orbs but they're women with big puffed up hair with an expression of MADON.

> BIGTOE BIGTOE BIGTOE We've been tryign to get you here for ages you're finally here

BigToe asks "where am i"

Start cutting up meat

>Listen Tony we've been noticing you we've all been noticing you here and we really want to help you out. You're just not doing enough out there for us for anything. 

> OH MY GAWD he doesn't get it you need us to help you.

Who are you

>You can call us the great TAAR HAAK
>DIDNT YOUR MOTHER TEACH YOU ANY MANORS

They argue and the sisters say 

>SHADDUP AND EAT THE MEAT

BigToe keeps eating and doesn't feel full. They taste amazing these coalcuts you don't really get them in Barovia.

The sisters are all jabbering at eachother arguing saying shutup.

Loook at BT sympathetically

>TOny you really need a womans influence in your life you're quite lacking

BT: What do you mean! I'm the epitome of class

>We know we're here to help you to give you a femanine touch to help you with all y our situations you want our help?

BigToe accepts but is also like what

BigToe has to say OK 5 times for each of them they say 

> GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE

And kick BigToe out.

### Shivers
Shivers is in a quiet dark room with the fireplace and the wooden box. He sees the fireplace is relatively low. It's pretty calm at the moment. 

S: Well it's nice to sit down... but that box.

> You don't want to htink about it you don't.

And your eyes are drawn away from it and as they are you see a glint above the fireplace. There's something above it you haven't seen before. Is that a picture frame? That wasn't there before but the fireplace is too low to make it out.

S: What? I don't remember putting that there

SHivers gets up to take a closer look.

He gets up closer and past the box (it shudders for a second.)

The fireplace isnt' getting any closer as Shiver's approaches.

The box appears to be moving further away though.

S: Can I try to feel one more time?

Shivers stops when he realizes he isn't getting closer to this picture frame. He looks back even though he really doesn't want to. Sees the box and there's whispers and he hears them in his head and they're starting to come louder and louder but they feel like they might be overwhelming again. BUT it seems like he'll be ok this time.

S: Savroks said I shouldn't look in but maybe I can look just this once.

The whispers get louder as he gets closer to the box.

Shivers lets the whispers in.

"I can handle this" he thinks. THe whispers gets real loud.

A womans voice with authority

SHIVERS SHIVERS HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE

whispers say "CHOSEN CHOSEN CHOSEN"

Shivers starts to shake and feels the fire behind him grow closer (or larger?)

S: Who is this?? I know you! But I can't say

> HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN TO ME SHIVERS

S: I don't know what I did! Please tell me.

Flame proceeds to get hotter and hotter behind him.

Shivers turns around and walks towards the flame. In the fire there's a figure of... a woman someone he respected so much... well did respect. Oh god... this is lady Wachner.

S: My lady I... I want to say I'm sorry but. The lies. How could you let me believe what I believed?

> It was all for the greater good Shivers, you were my CHOSEN KNIGHT

The flames burst up and a scene very familiar to shivers appears a scene of 3 guards over 3 civilains. The flames spill over them as their throats are slit and blood pours out.

He sees himself with his spear rushing into the guards that just slit the throats as these humans die choking on their blood in front of him.

Voices start whispering "shivers" "this was you you did this you did this shivers you did this to us shivers"

S: no! that was just-

Wachner shrivels and shrivels in the flame.

Then a small voice behind shivers says

>Shivers? Shivers look away now. I'll protect you now just look away from that let me bear this burden for you.

Shivers half turns around and falls to his knees.

The full horror of what Shivers has done is apparent to him now. This horrific scene seeing Wachner shrivel and burn but Shivers rips himself away and he falls half away able to pry his eyes from the scene.

S: Savnok tell me was it all for nothing? Was I really there?

>no... don't worry about that anymore

S: Savnok I feel like I'm missing something I've strayed I've... the past day I've ran into battles I swear I never would have done. I used to be brave but I would have caution. What is wrong with me.

>Theres nothing wrong with you shivers its whats wrong with barovia. its what strahd has done to everyone in barovia. THe land is traumatized by him.

S: But I need to be strong Savnok but I feel like I've lost that over the years.

Flames are starting to die down and the whispers fade. He hears a faint sucking sound behind him.

 *Hold on let me turn off noise supression.*

Savnok is drawing black oil from the fireplace into his hand and his other hand is pointed towards the box where the black oilyness flows to.

S: Savnok what ar eyou doign to the box?

>I'm putting these memories away so they don't hurt you anymore.

S: I understand you're looking out for me but shouldn't I make that decision.

>You can't handle that right now. You'll be ready and I'm gonna helpyou be ready for that when the time comes... For now let's just put it in the box.

S: But my friends I've seen them fall, what if the box can help me?

> Do you trust me shivers?

S: Of course you've helped me survive these last... 40 years

> I want to help you for the next 40 years and the next 40 years after that. You've always been you.

S: That's the thing I haven't felt like I did when I was younger.

The fire finally dies down to where it was before. There's a pop sound. Savnok puts his hands at his sides again. He looks down, thoughtful almost. 

>It's been really hard for you lately hasn't it shivers

S: It has, I want to help but I feel as if my age is getting the better of me.

>its not true you're getting stronger every day every fight you do. Tomorrow you're gonna feel stronger almost... leveled up

S: how can you promise such a thing

>no one knows me better than you and no one knows you better than me. I believe in you.

Shivers sees that familiar patients he's always seen in savnok sympathetic patient always listening to him.

S: What did I do to deserve such a good friend Savnok.

> You were strong and I believe exactly what Lady W believed that you are the chosen one you are the one that will destroy Strahd forever.

S: I don't know what I've done to deserve this faith you have in my but I'll try to live up to it.

>Let me give something that might help you

Pulls out a cloak of pure blackness.

S: Ah a blanket.

>This will protect you when you're in need this will be there for you. Are you ready?

S: Oh I suppose!

>To go back to a good sleep and wake up tomorrow.

S: If yous ay it will be so I believe it savnok

> I know it will.

Shivers reaches out to grab his arm not grabbing the cloak first. They awkwardly transfers the cloak to shivers and the scene goes to blackness back to sleeps.\

### Out of dream

Rinn makes a survival check and hears / sees nothing. Identifies potions and reads a [[The Oath Celestial]]. Identifies the potion. Book is falling apart crumbling. It's like a prayer book for the morning lord. 

R: Uhhh I feel like I'm not gleaning anything extra from this but maybe Firaxel will like it.

Trades places with Firaxel. Firaxel and Rinn notice a new cloak on Shivers and see the knife that was given to Wendak.

Potions of invulnerability.

---

### Rinn
Rinn finds herself somewhere else. She recognizes it. A tower iron bars behind her wind is howling. Seems kinda cold. [[Sykane]] is at his desk quill scratching on parchment.

Only source of light here is the glow in his crystal red eyes he doesn't acknowledge her presence. 

Rinn looks for the thing that we earlier saw in [[Argynvostholt]], the symbol that was behind the morning lord.

She sees the symbol. She sees a seal and the seal is not downwards its on its side like a letter seal. Seems like its the wax seal that [[Sykane]] uses.

She looks over at [[Sykane]]. It's dark this time which is different than last time. She sees his profile and is awkwardly standing 15 feet away.

R: What'cha writing.

Quill is going then it stops. He puts it down. He picks up the chair and turns it to face Rinn. Crosses one leg over the other, his eyes burning towards her. He looks at Rinn.

Leans forwards. 

> Do you know why i brought you here today.

Leans back again.

> Listen Rinn I like you but I've observed that you aren't using the tools that I give you. My gifts... Freely given, I just can't help but be dis-appointed. Now of course it as your discretion how to use these powers but I would be _loathed_ to take them away due to lack of use.

He looks at Rinn expectantly.

R: Well I used your powers recently but unfortunately due to the nature of this place there's a lot of things that might be... immune to that kind of shit.

> Rinn. You must not be hesitant. I pulled you out of the cold mists embrace that day on yesterhill Rinn. I. Gave you those power which are beyond those of anyone in Barovia have even Strahd. I expec tyou to use those power. I expect you to rot enemies. I want Barovians to make tales of the dread wizard Rinn. I want them to know what true powers can do.


R: I will certainly not hold back from my necrotic powers.

>Good.

He turns back. 

R: What's the seal? On your papers I saw it today.


He seems surprised?
> Well, it is my symbol.

R: Your symbol?

> Yes my symbol.

R: Do you have some sort of hold on [[Argynvostholt]].

>*Scoffs.*   No.

Starts scratching again with the quill.

R: Well while I'm here do you have some paper in and ink?

>Get out.

### On watch

Firaxel hears something but doesn't see anything out of place. Thinks it came from below him. Goes to look. Doesn't see anything that seems different. Goes downstairs to room below, stealthily opens door. Sees someone trying to very poorly hide behind very old wine barrels and a trail of blood leading up to the person hiding.

They're breathing raggedly

F: Hello

?: Fuckkk

![[Pasted image 20220113210128.png]]

F: Sir do you need healing

?: Yeah, yeah I do.

F: What happened sir?

?: oh thank the morning lord. Whale...

Dusk elf wearing leather armor bleeding profusely from a wound in his side.

?: Shit uhh listen i uh you know the uh ah that vistani - ah can you heal me real quick I'm bleeding here.

Firaxel heals mystery man.

?: Well god damn. Thank you young man, can I shake your hand? I wanna shake your hand.

F: Yeah of course. Firm handshake.

?: Gotta have a firm handshake its a sign of respect. Yeah I bet you know where I am from I'm from the Vistani camp near Vallaki.

He's looking for Arebel again and ended up here.

He was attacked by Needle blights. Heard us but didn't want to interact with us because didn't want the trouble.

They come upstairs and the strangers joins us for a rest. Orrrr not after seeing us he leaves to sleep in the hallway. He collapses and rests.

---

Rest of the night goes much more quietly. Long rest time.
