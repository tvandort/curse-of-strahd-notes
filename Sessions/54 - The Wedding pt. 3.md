Apparently Ireena ain't good enough, so says Frankenstein.

Creature seems to be reacting to nothing.

Devana asks Strahd if he knows this guy.

Apparently he is the Abbot or Abbot?

Strahd doesn't want perfection all he wants is Tatiana. With her by his side he will never be happier.

Abbots divine mission to end this curse over Barovia according to Strahd?

I suppose this implies what I once suspect that it may be the fact that Strahd is also stuck here?

Visalka is the flesh golem.

The abbots hands begin to shiver and ball into fists. In a quaking voice (his emotion range seems off? kinda seems angry) says "very well then Vasilka follow"

walks passed bigtoe and shivers without looking at them.

Firaxel tries to follow the abbot out but fails but i help him not fail.

Ismark starting to look paler.

Ismark protests. Starts loudly saying no. Says he'll cut Strahd down.

Rahadin drags Ismark off.

Rinn starts to cry.

Firaxel used the ravenkind symbol to chase off the knife finger boys. Talks to abbot who claims the mariage to his weird flesh golem might have broken the curse?

We can find him in Kresk

Rahadin being like "wat"

Firaxel goes back into the chapel and Firaxel and Shivers go to find gear.

## Chapel

Vows begin to be read. 

Strahd gazes deeply into Ireena's eyes.

Korvash asks us about using the necklass.

A dreamy expression crosses Ireena's face with a smile as she sounds like shes reading from a teleprompt.

THey are declared lord and wife!

Rahadin is stopping BigToe and Shivers. Lots of screaming as per usual.

## Chapel

Hairy bros wolf out.

Strahd looks at Ludmilla and says "Betrayer" and points at her.

Her shadow grows behind her as a shade of her or something?

Strahd shoots over to Irwin and Danika after misting as a legendary action.

Actually went over there to go up a I never noticed staircase. Maybe going after Roy?

Ludmilla doesn't like that her shadow detached itself. Gonna try to fuck that shadow up?

2 shots ring out from the ceiling. Roy
