The session began a diatribe on note taking.

[[Rinn]] identifying a wand.
[[BigToe]] goes up to the top first.

30 foot high pitched roof.
Lots of ravens coming in and out.
10 foot windows. Lead latticework fitted with transparent glass.

Angry black fog cloud in the center swirling into shapes in the center of the top tower.

#Ravens look at [[BigToe]].

Turns out the wand that [[Rinn]] is identifying is a [wand of magic detection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/wand-of-magic-detection). 3 charges 1 charge per action. 

[[Shivers]] attempts to throw [[Rinn]] across the gap in the stairs and instead falls into the hole and is hanging on the edge.

[[Wendak]] gets across the edge.

There appears to be a smokey thing. Kind of a pattern of a humanoid angrily holding their fists up and then distending to some formless angry cloud.

Angry cloud seems like its similar to [[Mordenkainen]]'s dream.

[[Shivers]] heads out to the roof. There's siege equipment and a statue of a #silver wyrmling (baby dragon?).

[[Rinn]] and [[Shivers]] bs about how the Morning Lord ain't real.

Seems like the shadow is like a manifestation of someone's anger. [[Korvash]] attempted to mind link to it but there's no mind there.

That's basically all we're getting here is that it's very anger.

Seems like the temple to the [[Morning Lord]] may have been a [[beacon]] of hope to all of [[Barovia]].

Maybe shadow was placed there to block the light? [[Firaxel]] throws a rock through it. The shadow seems to create a small pocket or tunnel around the stone and it's path as it passes through.

[[Wendak]] goes up to the roof where the Silver Dragon Wyrmling statue is. The mouth opens and says the following:

> When the dragon dreams its dream
> Within its rightful tomb,
> The light of Argynvost will beam
> And rid this land of gloom.

Crumbled audience hall a floor lower. Large wooden thrown with dragon wings. Faces 3 tall windows to the west. Figure in thrown with a lot of armor with gauntlet and great sword.

Opt not to fight it yet and head down a new set of stairs. We end up on a balcony after making a complete ruckus instead of fucking going quietly after 3 nat 1s from Shivers and Rinn twice.

Handsome men statues abound. We see a woman in the lobby. She sees us. Grand orange jacket. Studded leather armor with more weapons than a single person carry. Dark skin long curly hair down to her soldiers. Only one boot? Other leg seems to be made of wood and metal. 

Asks us who we are and aims a crossbow at us. [[Esmerelda]] called Es. Agreed not to fight. 

Plan on talking to whatever we're about to fight. 

Doomed failure of a knight. Hates [[Strahd]] who killed him and [[Argynvost]] and the knight he loved?

Despairs forever at his eternal life where he can't find love or light. Always a new name of a new generation, this entity has seen this before. Always ends violently.

Says that anyone who kills or wishes to kill [[Strahd]] is it's enemy. For no obvious reason [[Shiver]]s decided to fight the dead armor guy who wants to protect [[Strahd]] so that he will keep suffering.

The armor suit raises its gauntlet. Summons a bunch of soldiers or something.
