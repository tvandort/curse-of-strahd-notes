Head to pool. Some people go for dippies and some go for sippies.

Sparkle at the bottom of pond.

Xavier goes for a dip to get the chest? at the bottom of the pond.

Arogar goes to have a threesome with some old folks.

Chest is a bit lodged in the mud.

Xavier succeeds.

Sealed black wood box.

No seam on the box.

No markings.

Darker than black box.

There's a really subtle seam.

Magically made clearly.

Would be difficult to open.

Probably opened magically.

Jojo tries a 3rd level dispell. Hears a click and it opens.

Old journal inside.

Very faded symbol of house of strahd.

Jojo starts reading it. We throw the box into the lake.

Old couple that Arogar made kiss and breathed on are whispering and laughing.

We head towards the sheep pen. Large dude working with them.

say hello to luca hes very big.

Sheep names: Polka dot. Spot. Luca is dragging Wendak around. Brownie missing. Billie new favorite.

Shivers gets a sense of good from Luca.

Brownie let Luca pet her then just was missing.

Sheep disappear at night when Luca is sleeping. Also helping fix the fence.

Luca is a big dude. 

Xavier finds sheep bones.

Couple of bones.

Fence isn't broken anywhere.

Bite marks on bones. Small.

Discuss how to deal with the presumably possessed child.

---

Bigtoe and luca chat while walking to rocks.

Costel is Luca's dad whos dead.

Luca finds out that the fence isn't broken and gets bigmad. BigToe gets Bigmad with him.

Anna Kreskov told Luca the fence was broken.

Turds fled to valinok after he slaughtered a bunch then attacked them.

his first visitors were wild druids who thought he was a savior blah blah blah.

Younger brother 25 years old. Mom didn't tell him.

His brothers name is Surgei. Strahd saw a vision. Arguing about Sergei.

I think they're talking about mom's love. Convinced mom to travel to castle. On the way they she died in a carraige crash.

Sergei kept going to castle.

Gave strahd a tooth of shai hulud.

Sergei doesn't know war he gives people shit. He's a morning lord dude. He's everythign strahd isnt.

Sergei is probably into Tantiiana. STrahd has new partner petrina something.

She tells strahd about a place of power in mount balinok.

Rahadin has been around forever and protested involvement with patrina.

Rahadin is as typical a stick in the mud.

The love is a wretched embarrassment.

Strahd falls in love with Tatiana who is who Sergei has brought.

Sergei is my friend but also bitter rival.

Sergei may be as powerful as strahd?

Tatiana is like fuck this nerd sergei is better.

Fucked off to balinok with patrina.
