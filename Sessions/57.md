Wendak flying with Mordenkienen back to his home thing.

BigToe wakes up and he's different. He looks over, so is Shivers. Shivers' eyes have bags under them and they're pupilless.

BigToe looks like his skin was removed like just meat near his eyes. Like he's got exposed bits. Like lunchmeats.

They both feel terrible and its dark.

There's a bunch of discarded armor and other refuse. 

BigToe sees a man with tan skin and stubble.

Ralphie is a new character. He says "oy".

BigToe and Shivers try to avoid him. 

He says "oy" again.

He's here to beat Strahd.

His name is Arogar.

Its our equipment around them on the ground. BigToe starts to look around through the stuff. He finds little toady after a tense moment.

Little toadie won't stay on bigtoe anymore.

toadie gives bigtoe a look of fear. toadie smacks bigtoe with his tongue in a friendly way. he hops back up and looks suspiciously at aragor.

Bigtoe finds the sending stone (orb) that mordenkeinen has the pair to message mordenkeinen.

Rinn, Mordenkeinen, Firaxel, and Wendak head back to pick up Arogar, BigToe, and Shivers.

Shivers: "Your hair! It's like a black and white cookie!"

Rinn, Wendak, Firaxel, and Mordenkeinen fly to the windmill and take a short rest.

Arogar refers to Strahd as prey. Says his master sent him. His black warhorse radiates a dark aura.

Shivers asks him why his hair is like that. Arogar asks Shivers and BigToe if they've heard of the morning lord.

Shivers says "Don't you start that with me!"
