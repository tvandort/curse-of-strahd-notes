[[Castle Ravenloft#Dining hall]]

BigToe and Korvash get into the dining hall.
Nothing behind the painting.
The organ appears to move but they couldn't move it.

[[Castle Ravenloft]] Upstairs

Devana kinda impersonates Strahd and then goes up to see Ireena.

Rahadin gets mad and tells Devana to leave.

Devana sees Strahd (the real one presumably) they have a pretty cordial chat.

Strahd: 
> Nothing that you can do will stop this Devana.

Devana mentions she isn't interested in stopping it, quite the opposite was there to make sure everything was ok.

[[Castle Ravenloft#Dining hall]]

Back in the organ room Shivers attempts to move the organ but rolls so well on athletics (28) that he thinks "maybe there's a key"

Turns out there's an extra pedal on the organ that slides the organ to the side.

There appears to be a tunnel behind it.

[[Castle Ravenloft#Chapel]]

Met Edward he isn't a dick like the hairy dudes behind me. He's an employee of strahd and very nervous.

All the wives are here which is weird cause it means its unlikely that any of them were fake Strahd.

We make small talk with Ludmilla, Volenta, and Eshcer.

Escher seems impatient. Volenta gave me some advice.

Ludmilla is chilling behind.

Escher dunks on Strahd and Ludmilla laughs slightly.

Rinn picks up some shit. 

Firaxel talks to Irwin and Danika

[[Castle Ravenloft#Dining hall]]

Frankly I don't know what's happening.

Rahadin comes down and is like wtf seeing Shivers head in BigToe's lap?

S: I must be more drunk than I thought I'm hearing screams.
R: Have you any explanation?
B: For?
R: For the door.
B: I didn't we were in there, we went through the main door, what door?
R: You have broken the vow of hospitality. You must leave.

BigToe argues.

R: You have desecrated my masters home.
B: we have done nothing of the sort.
R: You are to leave the grounds immediately. Through the front entrance.

BigToe tries to get his stuff back.

Rahadin says not until after the ceremony.

BigToe drags Shivers out.

On their way out BigToe uses spirit whispers and tells me he and Shivers got kicked out and that the Organ has an extra pedal that moves it to the side.

Devana is in the dark, and invisible. But that means she can't do a lot.

Listens for movement. Takes out a torch to see.

Goes to a door. 

Apparently there's a tarp (trap?) (hard to tell I can't see.)

Trap.

Foggy hallway with many door.

Lots of just fucking stuff in one room. (looks like someone lives here??)

Smell of decay in a room with a bubbling cauldron.

Stairs that go up.

Devana finds some extinct vintage of wine. Stops to have some.

K: _this is my first wedding_
?: Why is your hair doing that
K: this is my first wedding, i think they're crappy and stupid but yeah excited to see how it goes
?: I wouldnt say that out loud
K: soul bindings are way better than just saying stuff, why not soul bind

[[Castle Ravenloft#Outside|Outside]]

The organ door would have apparently lead outside? There's a door on the outside wall of the castle where roughly where the organ sits.

The two chumps attempt to punch down the wall?

Wendak and others hear a message about the fact that BigToe and Shivers got kicked out of the wedding.

---

[[Castle Ravenloft#Chapel|Chapel]]

Mentioned to Korvash to share that BigToe and Shivers got kicked out.

---

[[Castle Ravenloft#Basement|Basement]]

Devana couldn't find our stuff so went back upstairs.

---

[[Castle Ravenloft#Chapel|Chapel]]

Devana comes in and uses "Mask of Many faces" to do her hair and makeup and clothing which is black with red trim not super fancy but nice.

Wedding starts

Rinn gets called up to be the maid of honor.

Arabel comes in with two gold rings with ruby sapphire and onyx on them

Hear yelling a protests outside? Sounds like Ismark.

Ismark eventually sags and enters the chapel.

Rinn notices something is wrong with Ireena. Ismark is hesitating. Rahadin is whispering something to Ismark.

Ismark says Ireena's mind is not her own.

Rinn determines that Ireena's under the same charm effect as what he did during our first encounter.

Korvash mind links with Ireena. 

Strahd comes in.

Korvash talks to Ireena and isn't getting much of a response.

> S: Glad that my Tatiana returned after so many years apart.

Father Lucian begins the proceedings.

Mind linking shenanigans happens while the things are being read. 

Firaxel stands up.

Says that Ireena needs to be awake.

Strahd looks very angry at Firaxel and Firaxel needs to make a wisdom save (24 and wins). 

>S: Sit down Firaxel

He doesn't.

Rahadin moves and the doors fly open.

Warm light spills out we see a young man in very plain monk robes and a bald head with a giant stitched together flesh monstroncity like a women in a wedding dress

> You will find that I object to this union

Firaxel feels a wave of nasua overtake him when this new dude comes in.

The stitched together lady looks like ireena???

This dude has a symbol of the morning lord.
