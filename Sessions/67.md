Talk to Shivers about his depression. Asks Wendak to be on the lookout for Savnok. 

Then he does some insane bullshit with his eyes jesus chirst.

Arogar does a great job dealing with the townspeople. They kinda silently decide to end the creatures.

The townsfolk are hearded into the abbots place to wait while Wendak, BigToe, and Xavier dig graves.

Arogar gives a good burial speech.

3 inch diameter sun shaped indentation with roses around it. Engraved is the name Petrovna.

Ah it's for the fucking holy symbol of ravenkind.

Dimitri and Anna are shut in their home. Don't want to burry their kid.

Luca gives BigToe a letter to Lucas father but BigToe can't read.

Hands it off to Jojo to read.

Meralina Fidatov apparently has food and shelter.

Luca has no clue about any of this. Why is everything such a pain in the ass.

BigToe says he'll help Luca. 

Tasha Petrovna is an ancestor of Vargas' wife? Noble figure. Not like I know anything about this afaik. Might be why her family had control of Vallaki but again, whatever.

Apparently Meraline Fidatov lives across the road in the woods but on a path that you don't notice unless you know its there.
