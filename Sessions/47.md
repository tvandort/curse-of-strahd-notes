## Session 47

The #spiders attack at [[Argynvostholt]].

Cock shaped table exploded as a result of a fireball :(

Easily dispatched some #spiders.
Found some dead adventurers.
Lots of dragon imagery on all the furnature. Table legs etc.
Two statues of dragon knights.

Stained glass with Silver Dragons in flight.

Altar has a rising sun relief.

Found #revanants of the Silver Dragon order that are looking to exact revenge on [[Strahd]] potentially, they are dangerous.

The #revanants have attacked us. They don't like #radiant damage.
Killed one it went FWHARRRRRR. And it evaporated just the armor remains.

Defeated the #revanants.

If I was in [[Rinn]]'s head I would have heard [[Sykane]] sighing about [[Rinn]] not killing the last #revenant for some reason.

Firaxel somehow is unaware that the altar was a [[Morning Lord]] altar and that we're in the chapel of the [[Morning Lord]].

For some reason [[Shivers]] and [[BigToe]] smashed the altar to the [[Morning Lord]]. Firaxel is bigmad and I went up the stairs with him.

Exquisitely carved wooden thrown. Iron Shandelier with Silver Dragons. Jesus christ the interior designer needed to give this theme a rest.

Walked up some really tall towers off of the chapel.

After walking for a while we ran into more #revanants. Seems like one in each tower so far.

Killed one next to Wendak, Korvash, and Firaxel. Rinn fell through the floor fighting another.
Killed the other one too.
