a scarecrow was enjoying a good bird snack so we burst him into flames.

there a goats in a fence with no door

the next scarecrow attacks rinn after she approaches and gets paralyzed.

then we kill it.

we run after our new raven friend that shivers pumped a bunch of life into.

we pass a mansion

we find a tree with caged ravens after following raven.

the tree has a door in it. the door opens and this evil as fuck looking old lady is there.
