Weapon (dagger), rare

You gain a **+1**![](chrome-extension://gnblbpbepfbfmoobegdogkglpbhcjofh/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take **2d10**![](chrome-extension://gnblbpbepfbfmoobegdogkglpbhcjofh/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) poison damage and become [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

Proficiency with a dagger allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
